# Getting and Cleaning Data Project
Project repo for the Coursera class "Getting and Cleaning Data"

This repo contains one R file and a Code Book.

1. run_analysis.R is an R script which ingests data taken from the Samsung Galaxy S II smartphone and outputs a tidy data set in the form of a text file named tidydata.txt. The data contains information on smartphone readings from accelerometers and gyroscopes.  
2. CodeBook.md explains how the R script works, as well as the original and output data sets.
